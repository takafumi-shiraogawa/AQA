This code is a modification of [giorgiodomen/Supplementary_code_for_Quantum_Alchemy](https://github.com/giorgiodomen/Supplementary_code_for_Quantum_Alchemy)
developed by Dr. Giorgio Domenichini. Please refer to articles related to the original code:

AQA is also based on PySCF ([pyscf/pyscf](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf)).
The license and notice files of PySCF is included in `./aqa/`.

AQA is still under development and contain bugs.


## Modification
Analytical alchemical energy derivatives up to the third order in Kohn-Sham density
functional theory (KSDFT) as well as quantum alchemy-based rules and analysis methods
are added.
LDA, GGA, and global hybrid functionals are supported.
AQA was used in the following work:

The following modifications are made for PySCF:
- SCF convergence criteria are modified for APDFT calculations.
- The analytical derivatives are implemented based on the implementation of PySCF.


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/takafumi-shiraogawa/AQA
```
Please add a path of `aqa/` to PYTHONPATH since the current version of AQA
is not packaged.
Generation of chemical space with unique molecules depends on QML ([qmlcode/qml](https://github.com/qmlcode/qml)).
Please compile `frepresentations.f90` in `./aqa/mini_qml/` with F2PY.
The example of the command can be found in `./aqa/mini_qml/compile.sh`.
The license file of QML is included in `./aqa/mini_qml/`.

### Requirements
To install the required packages, please use `aqa_env.yml` or run the following commands:
```
conda install -c pyscf pyscf  
pip install basis_set_exchange  
conda install scipy  
conda install numpy  
conda install matplotlib  
conda install pandas  
conda install xarray  
pip install git+https://github.com/pyscf/properties  
```
Only PySCF ver. 2.2 is tested. The older version of PySCF cannot be used.
Please add a path of `properties/` to PYSCF_EXT_PATH.
